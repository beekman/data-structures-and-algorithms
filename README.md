# Reverse an Array


## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument.

## Input
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
## Output
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

## Approach & Efficiency
I sorted the array in place, using Math.floor to avoid an edge case where the two numbers in the middle are swapped twice and end up reversed.

## Solution
My whiteboard image only shows the first part of the solution I came up with, because I ended up working on this after hours at home (where I have no whiteboard). I'll make sure my whiteboarding is more detailed for future code challenges.
