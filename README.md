# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument.

## Input
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
## Output
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

## Approach & Efficiency
I sorted the array in place, using Math.floor to avoid an edge case where the two numbers in the middle are swapped twice and end up reversed.

## Solution
My whiteboard image only shows the first part of the solution I came up with, because I ended up working on this after hours at home (where I have no whiteboard). I'll make sure my whiteboarding is more detailed for future code challenges.

# Shift Array
## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
### Input	[2,4,6,8], 5
### Output  [2,4,5,6,8]
