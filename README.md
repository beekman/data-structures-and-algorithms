# Data Structures and Algorithms
My solutions for many coding challenges related to data structures and algorithms. I encountered some of these problems in [Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850). The rest of these problems are code challenges from [codewars.com](https://codewars.com).
