# Prime Numbers

The goal: Return an array of prime numbers, where a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. It should take in a single variable n representing how many prime numbers you should return.

But specifically, I donâ€™t want you to polish an algorithm and give me your best shot. Nor do I want your worst shot. I want you to show three versions of this app, each subsequent version that improves upon the prior version in some way (time and/or memory), such that your last version can give the most number of primes out of all your versions (so if v1 only can return at most 1000 primes before timing out, v2 should return more than this, and v3 more than v2).
